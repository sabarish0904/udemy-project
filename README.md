My new project

This project was developed as part of a Udemy web development course and serves as a hands-on exercise to practice and reinforce core frontend skills.

It is built using only HTML and CSS, with no frameworks or JavaScript, making it perfect for beginners who want to understand the building blocks of web design.

The main focus of the project is on creating clean layouts, applying effective styling, and implementing responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across different devices. The code is structured in a clear and organized way, following best practices, making it easy to read, understand, and expand upon.

This project offers a solid foundation for anyone starting their journey into frontend development.
